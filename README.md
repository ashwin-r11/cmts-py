# ðŸ“– cmts.py â€“ Interactive Linux Command Cheatsheet

`cmd.py` is your go-to interactive terminal assistant, designed to quickly show you the **most useful Linux commands** or let you explore any commandâ€™s **man page** in a clean, colorful way.

It works like a lightweight `fzf` for man pages â€” making it easier to refresh your memory without searching online every time.

* âœ… Displays a **colorful cheatsheet** of the most commonly used Linux commands when run without arguments.
* âœ… Query any command (`ls`, `grep`, `ssh`, etc.) to view its **man page** directly inside your terminal.
* âœ… Shows a **preview snippet** first (first 3000 chars) for quick reference.
* âœ… Option to pipe into `less` for **scrollable full view**.
* âœ… Works entirely **offline** (relies on installed man pages).
